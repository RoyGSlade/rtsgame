# Game Plan: Medieval RTS

## 🎮 Core Loop

Build your base → Gather and refine resources → Train units → Survive night waves → Expand and dominate.

## 🎯 Primary Modes

1. **Single Player (Test Mode)**: Android/iOS friends will playtest core mechanics.
2. **Multiplayer**:
   - **PvP Ranked**: Mobile vs. mobile and PC vs. PC only.
   - **Casual**: Fun mode with XP and rewards.
   - **Challenge Mode**: Timed challenges or economic tasks (e.g., "most gold fastest").

## 🎮 Gameplay Inspiration

- **Stronghold Crusader** – Castle defense, worker economy
- **Command & Conquer** – Combat flow
- **Cities: Skylines** – Happiness and city simulation layers

## 🧱 Visual + Audio Style

- Pixel-based, vibrant but simple style
- Chill medieval tone with clear visual icons

## 🎯 Unique Selling Points

- **Layered strategy**: No one meta. Happiness-based strategies can outperform brute force.
- **Multiple paths to power**: Items, education, food supply, special units.
- **Deep economy**: Auction house, spell books, training grounds, troop customization.
- **Authentic competitive RTS on mobile** with **low monetization**.
