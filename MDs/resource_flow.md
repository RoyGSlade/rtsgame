# Resource Flow Guide

This document outlines the RTS game's economic and resource mechanics.

## Core Resources

### üîß Materials
- **Logs ‚Üí Planks**
- **Stone ‚Üí Bricks**
- **Iron ‚Üí Steel**
- **Gold Ore ‚Üí Gold Coins**
- **Hide ‚Üí Leather**

### üçΩ Food Types
- Apples
- Bread
- Pork
- Poultry
- Eggs
- Dairy
- Beef

### üë• Population
- Citizens produced based on happiness and housing.
- Each troop consumes 1 citizen.
- Citizens also operate production buildings.
- Happiness affects population growth and troop strength.

### üí∞ Gold System
- Mined as **Gold Ore**, refined into **Gold Coins**.
- Used for advanced unit training, upgrades, and building costs.
- Excess resources and specialty items can be sold at the **Auction House**.

### üòä Happiness
- Increases via food variety, statues, gardens, housing, schools, healthcare, and entertainment.
- Decreases from decay, disease, overcrowding.
- Impacts population growth and unit combat strength.

## Production System

- All resource production comes from buildings.
- Buildings can be **leveled up** to improve cycle speed and yield.
- Adding more workers increases productivity, up to a capped limit.
- Requires a **Stockhouse** for goods and a **Granary** for food.

## Building Requirements

- Most buildings cost **wood**, **stone**, and/or **gold**.
- Advanced buildings also require **population** to operate.
- Construction begins with free placement of:
  - Castle (spawns King)
  - Construction Yard
  - Granary
  - Stockpile

## Unit Production

- Troops:
  - Swordsman, Spearman, Archer, Mage, Paladin, Mounted Swordsman, Mounted Archer
- Citizens are assigned to **Barracks** and converted into selected troop type.
- Special units (Mage, Paladin) require specific buildings:
  - **Mage Tower**, **Church**
- Special upgrades via **Monuments** or rare **Spell Books** found on map.

## Advanced Systems

- **Decay System**: Buildings wear down or can be destroyed.
- **Healthcare**: Plague doctors, medical tents reduce sickness, boost happiness.
- **Auction House**: Sell overflow for rare troop upgrades (e.g., flaming sword, mage staff).
- **Battlefield Buffs**: Supply carts like stew wagons can feed troops and boost stats.

## Summary

The economic engine is tied to:
- Worker placement
- Food diversity
- Upgrade paths
- Happiness management
- Strategic population and resource balancing
